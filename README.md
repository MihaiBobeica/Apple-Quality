# Apple-Quality
Apple Quality is a machine learning project to detect if an apple is good to eat based on size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, acidity
# First iteration
At the current moment, the algorithm has only input and output layers, with a total of 8 nodes. Thus, the algorithm does not perfom adequate at this state.
## Result
Even though the algorithm is unable to asses the quality of an apple, it acknowledges what are the qualities of good appels (values that diverge to infinity)
